_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
...  
24 hours
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
...
The degree of reduction made by ui and the teacher is very high
## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
...
The GUI is not generous enough, beautiful and concise

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
...
Can make good use of google, and when kivy does not know how to use it, be good at using its official documents for query

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
...
First define the structure of the data, then write the logic of the operation data, and finally design the ui, develop from the bottom up

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
...
Official kivy documentation, very useful: https://kivy.org/doc/stable/

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
... 
At the beginning of the kv file, I didnâ€™t understand its structure. Later, I found a lot of information on the Internet and found that many programming languages use this indentation method.
For example, the configuration file YAML of Java, and later I checked the kv files written by others on the Internet, and I gradually understood its principle. With different indentation,
Indicates its hierarchical structure

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
...
A class is an encapsulation of objects of the same type. It can make our logic clearer and make our code more concise. Others use your code for the second time.
Or when receiving your code to fix bugs, the efficiency is greatly improved
